    <string name="instructiontxts">∙ 2 bars of modeling clay\n∙ Small objects like rocks or bottle caps to simulate structures\n∙ A rectangular container measuring approximately 8 x 13 inches\n∙ A tightly sealed drinking bottle shorter than the container’s width\n∙ 6 ice cubes</string>
    <string name="st">Instructions</string>
    <string name="stepsss">1. Shape the modeling clay into two flat-topped land masses.\n2. Position the clay at opposite ends of the container. Fill the container with water until the clay is submerged halfway.\n3. Press small objects into one clay mass to represent houses and buildings, ensuring they are placed in various areas above the waterline.\n4. Use the plastic bottle to create waves by bouncing or rolling it toward the clay.\n5. Place ice cubes on the clay at the opposite end to represent glaciers. Leave the setup in a warm area and observe any changes over time.\n6. Once observations are complete, pour out the water and store the setup for future use if desired.</string>

    <string name="instructions">Instructions:</string>
    <string name="instructiontxtss">"Try studying your weather for a week. Take note of the weather and daily temperature at the same time every morning using a thermometer, your phone, or local weather reports. Compute the mean average of the climate calendar in th Philippine Climate Almanac and compare your recorded temperature average against the average temperature for the month. "</string>

    <string name="lastss">This app is informed by insights from Klimaalam written by Raissa Rivera Falgui illustrated by Harry Monzo (2022).</string>
    <string name="instructionstxt">∙ two thermometers\n∙ a clear glass jar/bottle big enough to hold one of the thermometers.</string>
    <string name="instructionsstxt">Do this on a sunny day.</string>
    <string name="sstepss">1. Turn both thermometers on and put one inside the jar. Cover it.\n2. Lay the jar in direct sunlight on its side, with the other thermometer beside it, but not touching it. Make sure that the sun is shining directly on both thermometers.\n3. Check temperature after two minutes. Which one has the higher temperature? How many degrees is the difference?</string>
    <string name="sbelow">This simple experiment will show how Arrhenius’ observation led him to make the connection between carbon dioxide and the warming of the Earth.</string>
    <string name="slast">This app is informed by insights from Klimaalam written by Raissa Rivera Falgui illustrated by Harry Monzo (2022).</string>
    <string name="sinstructiontxt">∙ two identical glass jars or bottles\n∙ ceramic saucers\n∙ boiling water\n∙ 6 ice cubes</string>
    <string name="ssstepss">1. Fill about 1/2 of one jar with room temperature water and the other with the same amount of boiling water.\n2. Place a saucer on the top of each jar.\n3. After three minutes, put three ice cubes in each saucer.</string>
    <string name="whathappen">What happened inside each jar?</string>
    <string name="whathappens">In the experiment, water quickly evaporates and condenses in the jar with hot water. In the same way, greater heat causes more water from the surface of the Earth to evaporate, condense, then turn into rain.</string>
    <string name="beloww">"This experiment will show how an increase in temperature make a difference in the amount of rainfall. "</string>

    <string name="instructiontxst">∙ the model you made in melting ice experiment, refilled with water.\n∙ empty water bottle.\n∙ a pack of toothpicks or fallen branches, flower stems or plants.\t</string>
    <string name="steepss">1. Study your current model. What do you think can be done to prevent the waves from reaching the houses?\n2. Try making a barrier by sticking toothpicks up in the clay along the waterline.\n3. Roll the bottle to make waves. How successful is your barrier? What else do you think you could do to keep water from reaching the houses and buildings? Try it on your model. Compare your methods and results with each of your classmates.</string>
